# WiKi-FDH (Python)
## Introduction

Designed for dexterous hand debugging and secondary development, WiKi-FDH includes two versions: v1 and v2.
## v1

Provides customized demos for each control protocol.
## v2

Secondary development library.

## Details
The main purpose of WiKi-FDH is to facilitate the process of debugging and enhancing the functionality of dexterous hands through software development. The two versions cater to different needs and skill levels of users.

    v1 is geared towards users who are looking for quick demonstrations and examples on how to use the various control protocols with a dexterous hand. It provides ready-to-run code snippets and demos that showcase the basic functionalities of the system. This version is ideal for beginners who want to get a hands-on experience with the hardware and software without delving too deep into the intricacies of programming.

    v2 is designed for more advanced users who wish to extend the capabilities of the dexterous hand through custom development. The secondary development library in v2 offers a set of tools, functions, and APIs that can be leveraged to create new control algorithms, interfaces, or applications. This version allows users to dive deeper into the system and customize it to their specific needs, enabling the creation of innovative solutions and enhancements.

Overall, WiKi-FDH (Python) is a powerful toolset that can help researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the field of robotics and automation to work more efficiently with dexterous hands.
